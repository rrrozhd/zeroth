# zeroth-sdk protocol prototype

This source tree preserves the proposed lean client and instrumentation
boundary for Zeroth's economic debugger.

> **Release blocked:** do not publish or recommend this package yet. Its client
> routes now have authenticated server implementations, retrieval methods, and
> client-to-server tests. The remaining block is operational: no production
> hosted endpoint, managed provider credentials, or supported release exists.
> WorkOS activation and Paddle commerce are implemented but have not completed
> a real sandbox/production transaction. The `0.0.0.dev0` version and
> `tool.zeroth.release.publish = false` marker encode that hold.

The SDK contains only public wire contracts, HTTP client operations, and the
instrumentation namespace. It does not ship the Zeroth runtime, service,
economic plane, database migrations, or web console.

Production backtests require 5–25 labeled, tool-free cases. The five-case
example is the shortest real first-value request; replace its synthetic labels
with representative cases before using its verdict. Backtests may make several
provider calls, so they use a separate 120-second timeout by default while
ordinary ingestion keeps the client's normal 10-second default. Set
`backtest_timeout` explicitly for slower providers. Inputs and expected outputs
are used ephemerally. The service retains only a keyed request digest and the
result, so an exact retry returns the immutable prior decision without spending
provider-call credits again.
